* What activities did you do as the driver? What activities did you do as the navigator?


I was the driver for method 1 and the navigator for method 2.


* What are the advantages and disadvantages of serving in each role?


I prefer to be the navigator instead of driver just because I prefer to do things my own way but sometimes is nice to let others lead the way that something is being programmed.


* How often did you and your partner switch roles? Did you switch often enough?


As I was supposed to be driver; I often expressed my opinion which led to me navigating when I was not supposed to. If felt that we both were the navigators whenever my partner was brain storming and trying to figure out what to do.


* Which is your preferred role and why?


I preferred to navigate because I like to exercise what I know in programming and I prefer to show the path rather than follow the path; it’s just personal preference.


* Explain why this is a BAD test case for your method: assertEquals("bird", MedianSolver.median(new String[]{"bird", "cat", "dog", "ant"}))
Because my sorting algorithm assumes that we are sorting through alphabetical order; if I wanted another way to sort my test would fail. Here also we are using an odd number for length; we should also test for odd and even lengths.
 
* Explain how you could change the test to make it "valid" and explain how you could change the specification so that this is considered a "good" test
        String[] stringArray = {“bird”, “cat”, “dog”, “ant”};
        String result = MedianCalculator.findMedian(stringArray);
        assertTrue(result.equals(“cat”) || result.equals(“dog”));
